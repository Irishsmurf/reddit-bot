# reddit-bot
Java Reddit bot project for raspberry pi. 

This is my personal project of generic reddit bot that replies specific message to comments that fullfill given criteria.

At first, I was going to write this in python (since I read that python is great for this job and has raspberry pi offers great support for this language), but then I read this: http://www.teamten.com/lawrence/writings/java-for-everything.html. As of right now bot is ready, stable and working. Effect can be seen here: http://www.reddit.com/user/TweetsInCommentsBot.

I made this project as a showcase for my clean code skills :) If you have any questions feel free to ask them!
